Also Chars and Bytes are string iterator types, 
but while the next function of Chars returns the next character of the string, 
the next function of Bytes returns the next byte of the string. 
These string functions are both different from the as bytes function, 
which returns a slice reference on the bytes of the string It is also quite 
typical to iterate over a slice, an array, or a vector. Strings are not iterators, 
slices, arrays, nor vectors. But, just like a string iterator is obtained by 
invoking the chars function, so a slice, array, or vector iterator is obtained 
by invoking the iter function.
